<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">And my song I will sing;  
My speech I will pronounce  
To silence royal bards,  
In presence of their chief,  
I will greet to deride,  
Upon them I will break  
And Elphin I will free.  
Should contention arise,  
In presence of the prince,  
With summons to the bards,  
For the sweet flowing song,  
And wizardsâ€™ posing lore  
And wisdom of Druids,  
In the court of the sons of the Distributor  
Some are who did appear  
Intent on wily schemes,  
By craft and tricking means,  
In pangs of affliction
