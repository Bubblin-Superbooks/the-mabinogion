For you cannot judge between truth and falsehood.  
If you be primary bards formed by heaven,  
Tell your king what his fate will be.  
It is I who am a diviner and a leading bard,  
And know every passage in the country of your king;  
I shall liberate Elphin from the belly of the stony tower;  
And will tell your king what will befall him.  
A most strange creature will come from the sea marsh of Rhianedd  
As a punishment of iniquity on Maelgwn Gwynedd;  
His hair, his teeth, and his eyes being as gold,  
And this will bring destruction upon Maelgwn Gwynedd.”</pre><hr class="section"><pre class="  ">“Discover thou what is
