And then, in thine own person do thou remain there watching, and thou wilt see the dragon fighting in the form of terrific animals.  And at length they will take the form of dragons in the air.  And last of all, after wearying themselves with fierce and furious fighting, they will fall in the form of two pigs upon the covering, and they will sink in, and the covering with them, and they will draw it down to the very bottom of the cauldron.  And they will drink up the whole of the mead; and after that they will sleep.  Thereupon do thou immediately fold the covering around them, and bury them in a kistvaen, in the strongest place thou hast in thy dominions, and hide them in the earth.  And as long as they shall bide in</p></div> </div>
