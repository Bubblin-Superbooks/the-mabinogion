<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">It is incomparable;  
It comes from four quarters;  
It will not be advised,  
It will not be without advice.  
It commences its journey  
Above the marble rock,  
It is sonorous, it is dumb,  
It is mild,  
It is strong, it is bold,  
When it glances over the land,  
It is silent, it is vocal,  
It is clamorous,  
It is the most noisy  
On the face of the earth.  
It is good, it is bad,  
It is extremely injurious.  
It is concealed,  
Because sight cannot perceive it.
