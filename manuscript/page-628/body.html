<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">What the first impression  
Of his primary thinking;  
What became his clothing;  
Who carried on a disguise,  
Owing to the wilds of the country,  
In the beginning?  
Wherefore should a stone be hard;  
Why should a thorn be sharp-pointed?  
Who is hard like a flint;  
Who is salt like brine;  
Who sweet like honey;  
Who rides on the gale;  
Why ridged should be the nose;  
Why should a wheel be round;  
Why should the tongue be gifted with speech  
Rather than another member?  
If thy bards, Heinin, be competent,  
Let them reply to me, Taliesin.‚Äù</pre></div> </div>
