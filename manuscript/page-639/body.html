Of the ruddy wine,  
Planted on sunny days,  
And on new-moon nights;  
   And the white wine.

The wheat rich in grain  
And red flowing wine  
Christ’s pure body make,  
   Son of Alpha.

The wafer is flesh,  
The wine is spilt blood,  
The Trinity’s words  
   Sanctify them.

The concealed books  
From Emmanuel’s hand
