<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Solomon did obtain  
In Babelâ€™s tower,  
All the sciences  
   In Asia land.

So did I obtain,  
In my bardic books,  
All the sciences  
   Of Europe and Africa.

Their course, their bearing,  
Their permitted way,  
And their fate I know,  
   Unto the end.

Oh! what misery,  
Through extreme of woe,  
Prophecy will show
