<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">I am endeavouring to retrieve  
The loss I may have suffered;  
Complete the attempt I hope,  
Since Elphin endures trouble  
In the fortress of Teganwy,  
On him may there not be laid  
Too many chains and fetters;  
The Chair of the fortress of Teganwy  
Will I again seek;  
Strengthened by my muse I am powerful;  
Mighty on my part is what I seek,  
For three hundred songs and more  
Are combined in the spell I sing.  
There ought not to stand where I am  
Neither stone, neither ring;  
And there ought not to be about me  
Any bard who may not know  
That Elphin the son of Gwyddno
