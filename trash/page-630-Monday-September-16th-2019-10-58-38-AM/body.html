<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">And the name of the element,  
And the name of thy language,  
And the name of thy region.  
Avaunt, ye bards above,  
Avaunt, ye bards below!  
My beloved is below,  
In the fetter of Ariansod  
It is certain you know not  
How to understand the song I utter,  
Nor clearly how to discriminate  
Between the truth and what is false;  
Puny bards, crows of the district,  
Why do you not take to flight?  
A bard that will not silence me,  
Silence may he not obtain,  
Till he goes to be covered  
Under gravel and pebbles;  
Such as shall listen to me,  
</pre></div> </div>
