And with all these he went into Ireland.  And in Ireland there was great fear and terror concerning him.  And when Arthur had landed in the country, there came unto him the saints of Ireland and besought his protection.  And he granted his protection unto them, and they gave him their blessing.  Then the men of Ireland came unto Arthur, and brought him provisions.  And Arthur went as far as Esgeir Oervel in Ireland, to the place where the Boar Trwyth was with his seven young pigs.  And the dogs were let loose upon him from all sides.  That day until evening the Irish fought with him, nevertheless he laid waste the fifth part of Ireland. </p></div> </div>
