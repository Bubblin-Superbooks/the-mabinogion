<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Without flesh, without bone,  
Without vein, without blood,  
Without head, without feet,  
It will neither be older nor younger  
Than at the beginning;  
For fear of a denial,  
There are no rude wants  
With creatures.  
Great God! how the sea whitens  
When first it comes!  
Great are its gusts  
When it comes from the south;  
Great are its evaporations  
When it strikes on coasts.  
It is in the field, it is in the wood,  
Without hand, and without foot,  
Without signs of old age,  
Though it be co-Ã¦val  
</pre></div> </div>
