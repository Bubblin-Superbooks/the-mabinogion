<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">From the high Father,  
Brought seed for growing  
   That Eve might sow;

But she then did hide  
Of the gift a tenth,  
And all did not sow  
   Of what was dug.

Black rye then was found,  
And not pure wheat grain,  
To show the mischief  
   Thus of thieving.

For this thievish act,  
It is requisite,  
That all men should pay  
   Tithe unto God.
