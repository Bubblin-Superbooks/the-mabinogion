In calm paradise,  
From a left-side rib,  
   Bliss-throbbing Eve.

Seven hours they were  
The orchard keeping,  
Till Satan brought strife,  
   With wiles from hell.

Cold and shivering,  
To gain their living,  
   Into this world.

To bring forth with pain  
Their sons and daughters,  
To have possession
