And when they were made ready, they went into their ships, Lludd and those whom he chose with him.  And they began to cleave the seas towards France.</p><p>And when these tidings came to Llevelys, seeing that he knew not the cause of his brother’s ships, he came on the other side to meet him, and with him was a fleet vast of size.  And when Lludd saw this, he left all the ships out upon the sea except one only; and in that one he came to meet his brother, and he likewise with a single ship came to meet him.  And when they were come together, each put his arms about the other’s neck, and they welcomed each other with brotherly love.</p></div> </div>
