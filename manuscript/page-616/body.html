<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">I have been in India when Roma was built,  
I am now come here to the remnant of Troia.

I have been with my Lord in the manger of the ass:  
I strengthened Moses through the water of Jordan;  
I have been in the firmament with Mary Magdalene;  
I have obtained the muse from the cauldron of Caridwen;  
I have been bard of the harp to Lleon of Lochlin.  
I have been on the White Hill, in the court of Cynvelyn,  
For a day and a year in stocks and fetters,  
I have suffered hunger for the Son of the Virgin,  
I have been fostered in the land of the Deity,  
I have been teacher to all intelligences,  
I am able to instruct the whole universe.  
I shall be until the day of doom on the face of the earth;  
And it is not known whether my body is flesh or fish.
