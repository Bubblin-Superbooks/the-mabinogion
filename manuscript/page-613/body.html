On the fall of Lucifer into the depth of hell  
I have borne a banner before Alexander;  
I know the names of the stars from north to south;  
I have been on the galaxy at the throne of the Distributor;  
I was in Canaan when Absalom was slain;  
I conveyed the Divine Spirit to the level of the vale of Hebron;  
I was in the court of Don before the birth of Gwdion.
