<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Too many chains and fetters;  
The Chair of the fortress of Teganwy  
Will I again seek;  
Strengthened by my muse I am powerful;  
Mighty on my part is what I seek,  
For three hundred songs and more  
Are combined in the spell I sing.  
There ought not to stand where I am  
Neither stone, neither ring;  
And there ought not to be about me  
Any bard who may not know  
That Elphin the son of Gwyddno  
Is in the land of Artro,  
Secured by thirteen locks,  
For praising his instructor;  
And then I Taliesin,  
Chief of the bards of the west,  
Shall loosen Elphin
