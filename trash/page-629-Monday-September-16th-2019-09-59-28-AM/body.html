<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Made by the God of heaven;  
What the fairest flattering speech  
That was prepared by leuav;  
What meat, what drink,  
What roof his shelter;  
What the first impression  
Of his primary thinking;  
What became his clothing;  
Who carried on a disguise,  
Owing to the wilds of the country,  
In the beginning?  
Wherefore should a stone be hard;  
Why should a thorn be sharp-pointed?  
Who is hard like a flint;  
Who is salt like brine;  
Who sweet like honey;  
Who rides on the gale;  
Why ridged should be the nose;
