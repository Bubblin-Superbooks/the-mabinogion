Immoral ditties are their delight;  
Vain and tasteless praise they recite;  
Falsehood at all times do they utter;  
The innocent persons they ridicule;  
Married women they destroy,  
Innocent virgins of Mary they corrupt;  
As they pass their lives away in vanity,  
Poor innocent persons they ridicule;  
At night they get drunk, they sleep the day;  
In idleness without work they feed themselves;  
The Church they hate, and the tavern they frequent;  
With thieves and perjured fellows they associate;  
At courts they inquire after feasts;  
Every senseless word they bring forward;
