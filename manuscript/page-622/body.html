<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">For fear of a denial,  
There are no rude wants  
With creatures.  
Great God! how the sea whitens  
When first it comes!  
Great are its gusts  
When it comes from the south;  
Great are its evaporations  
When it strikes on coasts.  
It is in the field, it is in the wood,  
Without hand, and without foot,  
Without signs of old age,  
Though it be co-æval  
With the five ages or periods  
And older still,  
Though they be numberless years.  
It is also so wide  
As the surface of the earth;
