<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Seven hours they were  
The orchard keeping,  
Till Satan brought strife,  
   With wiles from hell.

Thence were they driven,  
Cold and shivering,  
To gain their living,  
   Into this world.

To bring forth with pain  
Their sons and daughters,  
To have possession  
   Of Asiaâ€™s land.

Twice five, ten and eight,  
She was self-bearing,  
The mixed burden
