<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Green as the limpid sheet of icicle;  
Three springs arise  
In the nape of his neck;  
Sea-roughs thereon  
Swim through it;  
There was the dissolution of the oxen  
Of Deivrdonwy the water-gifted.  
The names of the three springs  
From the midst of the ocean;  
One generated brine  
Which is from the Corina,  
To replenish the flood  
Over seas disappearing;  
The second, without injury  
It will fall on us,  
When there is rain abroad,  
Through the whelming sky;  
The third will appear
