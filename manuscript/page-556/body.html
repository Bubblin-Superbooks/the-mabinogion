And thus was Gronw Pebyr slain.  And there is still the slab on the bank of the river Cynvael, in Ardudwy, having the hole through it.  And therefore is it even now called Llech Gronw.</p><p>A second time did Llew Llaw Gyffes take possession of the land, and prosperously did he govern it.  And, as the story relates, he was lord after this over Gwynedd.  And thus ends this portion of the Mabinogi.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
