<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">On Troiaâ€™s race!

A coiling serpent  
Proud and merciless,  
On her golden wings,  
   From Germany.

She will overrun  
England and Scotland,  
From Lychlyn sea-shore  
   To the Severn.

Then will the Brython  
Be as prisoners,  
By strangers swayed,  
   From Saxony.

Their Lord they will praise,
