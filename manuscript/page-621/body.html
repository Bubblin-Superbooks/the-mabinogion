I shall liberate Elphin from the belly of the stony tower;  
And will tell your king what will befall him.  
A most strange creature will come from the sea marsh of Rhianedd  
As a punishment of iniquity on Maelgwn Gwynedd;  
His hair, his teeth, and his eyes being as gold,  
And this will bring destruction upon Maelgwn Gwynedd.”</pre><hr class="section"><pre class="  ">“Discover thou what is  
The strong creature from before the flood,  
Without flesh, without bone,  
Without vein, without blood,  
Without head, without feet,  
It will neither be older nor younger  
Than at the beginning;
