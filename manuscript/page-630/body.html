<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">My beloved is below,  
In the fetter of Ariansod  
It is certain you know not  
How to understand the song I utter,  
Nor clearly how to discriminate  
Between the truth and what is false;  
Puny bards, crows of the district,  
Why do you not take to flight?  
A bard that will not silence me,  
Silence may he not obtain,  
Till he goes to be covered  
Under gravel and pebbles;  
Such as shall listen to me,  
May God listen to him.”</pre><p>Then sang he the piece called “The Spite of the Bards.”</p><pre class="  ">“Minstrels persevere in their false custom,  
Immoral ditties are their delight;
