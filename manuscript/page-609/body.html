Let the fools be silent,  
As erst in Badon’s fight,—  
With Arthur of liberal ones  
The head, with long red blades;  
Through feats of testy men,  
And a chief with his foes.  
Woe be to them, the fools,  
When revenge comes on them.

With a sapient Druid’s words,  
Will set kind Elphin free  
From haughty tyrant’s bonds.  
To their fell and chilling cry,  
By the act of a surprising steed,  
From the far distant North,  
There soon shall be an end.  
Let neither grace nor health
