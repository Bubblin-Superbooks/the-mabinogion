<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Summer tilth to sow,  
Every man to feed,  
   Till great yule feast.

An angelic hand  
From the high Father,  
Brought seed for growing  
   That Eve might sow;

But she then did hide  
Of the gift a tenth,  
And all did not sow  
   Of what was dug.

Black rye then was found,  
And not pure wheat grain,  
To show the mischief  
   Thus of thieving.
