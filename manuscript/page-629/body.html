With genius not to be controlled,  
Be thou not untractable  
Within the court of thy king;  
Until thy rigmarole shall be known,  
Be thou silent, Heinin,  
As to the name of thy verse,  
And the name of thy vaunting;  
And as to the name of thy grandsire  
Prior to his being baptized.  
And the name of the sphere,  
And the name of the element,  
And the name of thy language,  
And the name of thy region.  
Avaunt, ye bards above,  
Avaunt, ye bards below!
