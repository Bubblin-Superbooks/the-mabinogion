<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">I was instructor to Eli and Enoc;  
I have been winged by the genius of the splendid crosier;  
I have been loquacious prior to being gifted with speech;  
I was at the place of the crucifixion of the merciful Son of God;  
I have been three periods in the prison of Arianrod;  
I have been the chief director of the work of the tower of Nimrod;  
I am a wonder whose origin is not known.  
I have been in Asia with Noah in the ark,  
I have seen the destruction of Sodom and Gomorra;  
I have been in India when Roma was built,  
I am now come here to the remnant of Troia.

I have been with my Lord in the manger of the ass:  
I strengthened Moses through the water of Jordan;
