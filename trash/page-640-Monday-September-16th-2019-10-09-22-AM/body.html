For this thievish act,  
It is requisite,  
That all men should pay  
   Tithe unto God.

Of the ruddy wine,  
Planted on sunny days,  
And on new-moon nights;  
   And the white wine.

The wheat rich in grain  
And red flowing wine  
Christâ€™s pure body make,  
   Son of Alpha.

The wafer is flesh,  
The wine is spilt blood,
