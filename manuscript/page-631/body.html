<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Vain and tasteless praise they recite;  
Falsehood at all times do they utter;  
The innocent persons they ridicule;  
Married women they destroy,  
Innocent virgins of Mary they corrupt;  
As they pass their lives away in vanity,  
Poor innocent persons they ridicule;  
At night they get drunk, they sleep the day;  
In idleness without work they feed themselves;  
The Church they hate, and the tavern they frequent;  
With thieves and perjured fellows they associate;  
At courts they inquire after feasts;  
Every senseless word they bring forward;  
Every deadly sin they praise;  
Every vile course of life they lead;  
Through every village, town, and country they stroll;  
Concerning the gripe of death they think not;  
Neither lodging nor charity do they give;
