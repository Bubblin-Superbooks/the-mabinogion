The second, without injury  
It will fall on us,  
When there is rain abroad,  
Through the whelming sky;  
The third will appear  
Through the mountain veins,  
Like a flinty banquet,  
The work of the King of kings,  
You are blundering bards,  
In too much solicitude;  
You cannot celebrate  
The kingdom of the Britons;  
And I am Taliesin,  
Chief of the bards of the west,  
Who will loosen Elphin  
Out of the golden fetter.‚Äù</pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
