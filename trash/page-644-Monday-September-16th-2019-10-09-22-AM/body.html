Their land they will lose,  
   Except wild Walia.

Till some change shall come,  
After long penance,  
When equally rife  
   The two crimes come.

Britons then shall have  
Their land and their crown,  
And the stranger swarm  
   Shall disappear.

All the angel’s words,  
As to peace and war,  
Will be fulfilled  
   To Britain’s race.”</pre></div> </div>
