<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">As the mountains of the Alps;  
Him death will not subdue,  
Nor hand or blades;  
There is the load of nine hundred wagons  
In the hair of his two paws;  
There is in his head an eye  
Green as the limpid sheet of icicle;  
Three springs arise  
In the nape of his neck;  
Sea-roughs thereon  
Swim through it;  
There was the dissolution of the oxen  
Of Deivrdonwy the water-gifted.  
The names of the three springs  
From the midst of the ocean;  
One generated brine  
Which is from the Corina,  
To replenish the flood
