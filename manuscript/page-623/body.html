Nor was it seen.  
It will cause consternation  
Wherever God willeth.  
On sea, and on land,  
It neither sees, nor is seen.  
Its course is devious,  
And will not come when desired;  
On land and on sea,  
It is indispensable.  
It is without an equal,  
It is four-sided;  
It is not confined,  
It is incomparable;  
It comes from four quarters;  
It will not be advised,  
It will not be without advice.  
It commences its journey
