Let no one be dissatisfied with his own,  
To despair will bring no advantage.  
No man sees what supports him;  
The prayer of Cynllo will not be in vain;  
God will not violate his promise.  
Never in Gwyddno’s weir  
Was there such good luck as this night.  
Fair Elphin, dry thy cheeks!  
Being too sad will not avail.  
Although thou thinkest thou hast no gain,  
Too much grief will bring thee no good;  
Nor doubt the miracles of the Almighty:  
Although I am but little, I am highly gifted.  
From seas, and from mountains,  
And from the depths of rivers,  
God brings wealth to the fortunate man.
