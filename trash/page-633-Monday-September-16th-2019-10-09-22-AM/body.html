<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Every deadly sin they praise;  
Every vile course of life they lead;  
Through every village, town, and country they stroll;  
Concerning the gripe of death they think not;  
Neither lodging nor charity do they give;  
Indulging in victuals to excess.  
Psalms or prayers they do not use,  
Tithes or offerings to God they do not pay,  
On holidays or Sundays they do not worship;  
Vigils or festivals they do not heed.  
The birds do fly, the fish do swim,  
The bees collect honey, worms do crawl,  
Every thing travails to obtain its food,  
Except minstrels and lazy useless thieves.

I deride neither song nor minstrelsy,  
For they are given by God to lighten thought;  
But him who abuses them,
