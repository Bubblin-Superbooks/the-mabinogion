And they both spent that year until it was the time for the feast at the palace of Heveydd Hên.  Then Gwawl the son of Clud set out to the feast that was prepared for him, and he came to the palace, and was received there with rejoicing.  Pwyll, also, the Chief of Annwvyn, came to the orchard with his hundred knights, as Rhiannon had commanded him, having the bag with him.  And Pwyll was clad in coarse and ragged garments, and wore large clumsy old shoes upon his feet.  And when he knew that the carousal after the meat had begun, he went towards the hall, and when he came into the hall, he saluted Gwawl the son of Clud, and his company, both men and women.  “Heaven prosper thee,” said Gwawl, “and the greeting of Heaven be unto thee.”  “Lord,” said he, “may Heaven reward thee, I have an errand unto thee.” </p></div> </div>
