But as to the knight whom thou seest yonder, it is Kai.  The fairest horseman is Kai in all Arthur’s Court; and the men who are at the front of the army hasten to the rear to see Kai ride, and the men who are in the centre flee to the side, from the shock of his horse.  And this is the cause of the confusion of the host.”</p><p>Thereupon they heard a call made for Kadwr, Earl of Cornwall, and behold he arose with the sword of Arthur in his hand.  And the similitude of two serpents was upon the sword in gold.  And when the sword was drawn from its scabbard, it seemed as if two flames of fire burst forth from the jaws of the serpents, and then, so wonderful was the sword, that it was hard for any one to look upon it.  And the host became still, and the tumult ceased, and the Earl returned to the tent.</p></div> </div>
