I was in Canaan when Absalom was slain;  
I conveyed the Divine Spirit to the level of the vale of Hebron;  
I was in the court of Don before the birth of Gwdion.  
I was instructor to Eli and Enoc;  
I have been winged by the genius of the splendid crosier;  
I have been loquacious prior to being gifted with speech;  
I was at the place of the crucifixion of the merciful Son of God;  
I have been three periods in the prison of Arianrod;  
I have been the chief director of the work of the tower of Nimrod;  
I am a wonder whose origin is not known.  
I have been in Asia with Noah in the ark,  
I have seen the destruction of Sodom and Gomorra;
