<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Through the mountain veins,  
Like a flinty banquet,  
The work of the King of kings,  
You are blundering bards,  
In too much solicitude;  
You cannot celebrate  
The kingdom of the Britons;  
And I am Taliesin,  
Chief of the bards of the west,  
Who will loosen Elphin  
Out of the golden fetter.”</pre><hr class="section"><pre class="  ">“Be silent, then, ye unlucky rhyming bards,  
For you cannot judge between truth and falsehood.  
If you be primary bards formed by heaven,  
Tell your king what his fate will be.  
It is I who am a diviner and a leading bard,
