<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Above the marble rock,  
It is sonorous, it is dumb,  
It is mild,  
It is strong, it is bold,  
When it glances over the land,  
It is silent, it is vocal,  
It is clamorous,  
It is the most noisy  
On the face of the earth.  
It is good, it is bad,  
It is extremely injurious.  
It is concealed,  
Because sight cannot perceive it.  
It is noxious, it is beneficial;  
It is yonder, it is here;  
It will discompose,  
But will not repair the injury;  
It will not suffer for its doings,
