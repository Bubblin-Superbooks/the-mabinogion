<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">With the five ages or periods  
And older still,  
Though they be numberless years.  
It is also so wide  
As the surface of the earth;  
And it was not born,  
Nor was it seen.  
It will cause consternation  
Wherever God willeth.  
On sea, and on land,  
It neither sees, nor is seen.  
Its course is devious,  
And will not come when desired;  
On land and on sea,  
It is indispensable.  
It is without an equal,  
It is four-sided;  
It is not confined,
