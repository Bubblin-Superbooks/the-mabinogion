To the master of sciences,  
Declare ye mysteries  
That relate to the inhabitants of the world;  
There is a noxious creature,  
From the rampart of Satanas,  
Which has overcome all  
Between the deep and the shallow;  
Equally wide are his jaws  
As the mountains of the Alps;  
Him death will not subdue,  
Nor hand or blades;  
There is the load of nine hundred wagons  
In the hair of his two paws;  
There is in his head an eye
