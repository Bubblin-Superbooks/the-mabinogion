<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">I have fled as a wolf cub, I have fled as a wolf in a wilderness,  
I have fled as a thrush of portending language;  
I have fled as a fox, used to concurrent bounds of quirks;  
I have fled as a martin, which did not avail;  
I have fled as a squirrel, that vainly hides,  
I have fled as a stag’s antler, of ruddy course,  
I have fled as iron in a glowing fire,  
I have fled as a spear-head, of woe to such as has a wish for it;  
I have fled as a fierce hull bitterly fighting,  
I have fled as a bristly boar seen in a ravine,  
I have fled as a white grain of pure wheat,  
On the skirt of a hempen sheet entangled,  
That seemed of the size of a mare’s foal,  
That is filling like a ship on the waters;  
Into a dark leathern bag I was thrown,  
</pre></div> </div>
