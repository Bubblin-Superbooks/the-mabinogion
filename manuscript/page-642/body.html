She will overrun  
England and Scotland,  
From Lychlyn sea-shore  
   To the Severn.

Then will the Brython  
Be as prisoners,  
By strangers swayed,  
   From Saxony.

Their Lord they will praise,  
Their speech they will keep,  
Their land they will lose,  
   Except wild Walia.

Till some change shall come,
