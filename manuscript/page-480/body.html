And there they found a fair and regal spot overlooking the ocean; and a spacious hall was therein.  And they went into the hall, and two of its doors were open, but the third door was closed, that which looked towards Cornwall.  “See, yonder,” said Manawyddan, “is the door that we may not open.”  And that night they regaled themselves and were joyful.  And of all they had seen of food laid before them, and of all they had heard of, they remembered nothing; neither of that, nor of any sorrow whatsoever.  And there they remained fourscore years, unconscious of having ever spent a time more joyous and mirthful.  And they were not more weary than when first they came, neither did they, any of them, know the time they had been there. </p></div> </div>
