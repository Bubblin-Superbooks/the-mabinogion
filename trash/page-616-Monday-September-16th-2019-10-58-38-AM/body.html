And when the king knew that he was the bard of Elphin, he bade Heinin, his first and wisest bard, to answer Taliesin and to strive with him.  But when he came, he could do no other but play “blerwm” on his lips; and when he sent for the others of the four-and-twenty bards they all did likewise, and could do no other.  And Maelgwn asked the boy Taliesin what was his errand, and he answered him in song.</p><pre class="  ">“Puny bards, I am trying
